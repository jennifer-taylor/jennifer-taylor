Hi! I'm Jennifer Taylor. I graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in Business Management and a concetration of Entrepreneurship and Small Business.

I've always had an interest in data and considered myself an analytical individual, so I've decided to switch gears and try to get into data analytics!

I'm self taught in the coding languages SQL, R, and Python, as well as in the data visualization tools Tableau and Power BI.

Although I'm self taught, I'm confident in the proficiency of my skills and I'm ready to showcase them! :)
